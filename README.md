# Socat for Windows with GitHub Actions

This project automates the compilation of Socat for Windows using GitHub Actions, inspired by [valorisa/socat-1.8.0.0_for_Windows](https://github.com/valorisa/socat-1.8.0.0_for_Windows). By automating the build process, we aim to provide the community with easy access to the latest versions of Socat for Windows, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.

## Features

- **Automated Builds**: Leverage GitHub Actions to compile the latest version of Socat for Windows.
- **Windows Compatibility**: Optimized for use on Windows systems.
- **Ease of Use**: Detailed instructions for downloading, installing, and using the compiled Socat.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get Socat up and running on your Windows system:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/raikiriww/socat_windows/releases) to find the latest version of Socat compiled for Windows. Download the zip file for the most recent release.

2. **Installation**:
   - After downloading, extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice on your computer.
   - To make Socat accessible from any command prompt or terminal window, you need to add it to your Windows PATH environment variable. Follow these steps to modify the PATH:
     1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' on your desktop or in File Explorer, and select 'Properties'.
     2. Click on 'Advanced system settings' on the left side to open the System Properties window.
     3. In the System Properties window, go to the 'Advanced' tab and click on the 'Environment Variables' button.
     4. In the Environment Variables window, scroll down under 'System variables' to find the 'Path' variable, then click 'Edit'.
     5. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click 'New' and paste the path to the folder where you extracted Socat. Click 'OK' to close each window.
     6. Open a new command prompt or terminal window. You should now be able to run Socat commands from anywhere without specifying the full path to the executable.

3. **Running Socat**: With Socat added to your PATH, you can open any command prompt or terminal window and execute Socat commands as needed. This setup allows for easy access to Socat's functionality from anywhere on your system.

For detailed Socat usage instructions and examples, refer to the official Socat documentation or the help command (`socat -h`).


## Build Process

2. **Compiling Socat**: The compilation uses predefined Windows environments and dependencies.
3. **Release**: Upon successful compilation, the build is automatically published to the GitHub Releases page.
